\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify statistically significant signals that signal potential short-term price moves.
  \item Convert the most promising signal(s) into an executable rule-based strategy.
  \item Evaluate performance via back-testing and a four-week live test (16~Jun – 14~Jul 2025).
  \item Document robustness, limitations and possible improvements.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Contents of Thesis}
\subsection{Market Mechanics}
Here I explain what Bitcoin is and what the value of Bitcoin represents. I then
cover the basics of auction theory and why it is important for understanding
how markets work. Finally, I discuss the efficient market hypothesis and its
relevance to algorithmic trading.

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
Here I describe the process of exploring the data. I look at the data in plain
terms, plot the bid- and ask-side deltas, check how often and how strongly
they move, and see whether large changes line up with later price moves. I
also use simple tools such as line charts and histograms to spot patterns that
seem to be statistically relevant.

\subsection{Risk \& Position Size}
Here I explain how I handle risk and position size. How I calculate the
position size and how I set the stop-loss and take-profit levels. How I came
up with the numbers and how I adjusted them.

\subsection{Automation and Test Run}
Here I describe how I automate the trading process. I explain how the bot
is set up to run automatically, how signals are processed, and how orders
are sent to the exchange. I also cover how I monitor the system, log trades
and errors, and set up alerts for any issues. Finally, I explain how I run a
test phase (paper trading) to make sure everything works as expected before
using real money.

This timeline could change and is just a rough estimate.

\section{Expected Delivery}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Python code for data handling, back-testing and live execution in a GitHub repository.
  \item Example datasets already available at
        \href{https://github.com/AJslashTracey/OBDeltaData}{OBDeltaData}.
  \item A statistical report comparing other strategies I tested and other signals I considered.
  \item Final thesis detailing methodology, live results and critical reflection.
\end{itemize}
